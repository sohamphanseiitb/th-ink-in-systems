Though systems science is very intuitive, its a bit tricky and difficult to grasp initially. However with the right reading and practice to think cohesively, mastering the art is not a big deal. Here are some books which help understand Systems Science intuitively. 

- **Thinking in Systems - A Primer** - by Donella Meadows, an extremely easy to read, yet powerful book, which will help you understand concepts in depth, keeping the mathematical intricacies at bay. As the name suggests, its a primer, it doesn't make you an expert in systems theory, however it still equips you with sufficient knowledge and tools to understand use the theory to comprehend and draw conclusions about events happening around you.

- **The Fifth Discipline** - by Peter Senge, this is one of the best management works in the last 75 years, and numerous students, instructors, businesses, government have learnt from it and implemented things in real life. Its longer and explores the intersections of systems science and management, but is a must-read for people who want to explore this highly inter-disciplinary field.

- After you are done with these, you can get over and read up Jay Forrester's and John Sterman's work: Business Dynamics: Modeling for a Complex World. If you are a student at IIT Bombay, you can take up the courses AE759: Fundamentals of Systems Engineering and IE604/CS752 System Dynamics Modeling and Simulation. 


<!--The beauty of computer programming is that you do not need to formally go to school to learn how to program. You can learn almost everything that you would need to know online, and for free. The following resources are some that I have used personally, that I highly recommend, for anyone looking to learn more about computer programming.

## [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

My personal favourite for learning full stack web development. They offer a great front and back end curriculum that requires you to complete a variety of projects in order to apply the knowledge that you learn during the lessons. As a bonus, at the end of the curriculum you will have a few impressive projects under your belt for your portfolio.

## [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

Not only does Codecademy have many great courses on various web development languages such as [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html), [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css), and [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript), but they even offer a course on [how to deploy a Jekyll site](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/deploy-a-website). If you are completely new to Jekyll, I would recommend working through that course as a great start for learning how to deploy your Jekyll site.

## [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)

A great resource not only for learning mathematics (what most people probably know Khan Academy for), but also [computer programming](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming). What Khan Academy offers that is different from the other two above resources is that it offers courses in [computer science related](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science) topics, such as [algorithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms) and [cryptography](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography). This is unique in that most online resources mostly focus on the programming side of things.-->

Deploying any system is not a simple deal. There are a lot of processes and decisions which go on into making a system operationally successful. In formal terms, these processes are called, 'System Life Cycle Phases'. Let's have a quick look at what these phases are:

- Concept Phase
- Development or Design phase
- Utilization Phase
- Maintainance Phase
- Retirement Phase

These are not at all difficult to understand. The concept stage is where the idea of the system is born. It consists all sorts of initial work, trying to find the problem, decisions on which part of the problem to address, proposing candidate solutions and shortlisting, solution implementation ideas. This is the phase where the foundation and overall plan of the system is laid. Estimates of cost, time to deploy and operate the system, maintainence plans are all conceptualized in this phase. It takes a significant amount of time in the lifetime of any system. 

Next, is the development phase. In this phase, we develop on the ideas, conceptualize their working, prove the hypotheses mathematically or with prototyping. This is where the system takes shape; from the crude idea to a refined product or service ready to perform flawlessly. All major design decisions are taken in this phase. Rigorous testing and validation is carried out for ensuring required performance and safety criteria.

Utilization phase is the deployment of the system on site. It is the final stage for the system designer, for, the system ownership is transferred to the user after this phase. Here is where the system realizes the goals and ends for what it was created. While operating, it is monitored well to ensure quick repairs and maintainence to reduce unoperational time and boost efficiency. Maintainence is usually carried out during the whole lifetime of the system, at regular intervals. Usually systems are designed to have low maintainence costs and frequencies, ensuring high reliability and incorporating fail safes and redundancies. 

It is expected of every system to possess a well-defined and a feasible plan for retirement and disposal in lieu of regulations. This is formally called the 'Retirement' or the 'disposal' phase of the system, meaning that the system has fulfilled its period and spectrum of operation and has to be retired. Depending on the kind of the system, different procedures are out in place, for instance, if its an electronic device, it is recycled and components and material is reused after filtration and processing. If its an automobile, there are licensed recyclers which disintegrate the vehicle, and separate useful components; rest of the chassis is either scrapped ot sent to a reprocessing station, for melting and recasting of metals. 

You should ahve by now understood, that a good systems designer, needs to see the system through, and focus on all phases - right from inception till retirement. Product disposal gives way to two important concepts - **cradle to grave** and **cradle to cradle** which are widely addressed in product design. We will look at them sometime later. 

I hope you got a fair idea of planning and significance of different phases of a system design. Stay tuned people!

By the way, feel free to mail me or give feedback about any of the articles, would love to hear from y'all!

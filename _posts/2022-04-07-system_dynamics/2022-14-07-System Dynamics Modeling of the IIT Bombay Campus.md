Hey folks! Here I am with a new case study which ties up everything you have read till now. The principles of modeling, causal loops all presented tpgether into one scenario with real world data. It was in my sophomore year at college, I started working on this project, under guidance of Prof. Rangan Banerjee. The goal was to develop a systems theory based approach energy use in large socio-economic systems. It all started when I got hold of any energy audit report of my college campus. It took no time to converge on the campus to be the system under observation. 

After talking to my guide and a couple of seniors I was able to get hold of some data and validate some bold assumptions I made, but the overall framework, although qualitative in nature turned out to be correct! Let me take you through it!!

We will focus on the energy usage by on campus residents. Students at IIT Bombay are comprised of degrees like BTech, MTech and PhD.
Every student is provided with a tube light, fan. In a group they are provided with water
heaters and washing machines. They are provided with food on a daily basis. Food cooking
is generally done with LPG at IIT Bombay campus. Since the energy usage at the campus is
entirely population residing on the campus, we present a qualitative yet detailed model of the
Population Dynamics at the IIT Bombay campus. To illustrate the model, we will be heavily
making use of the Causal Loop Diagram described in the sections above.

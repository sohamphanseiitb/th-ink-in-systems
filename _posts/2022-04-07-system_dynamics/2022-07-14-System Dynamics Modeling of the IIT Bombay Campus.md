Hey folks! Here I am with a new case study which ties up everything you have read till now. The principles of modeling, causal loops all presented tpgether into one scenario with real world data. It was in my sophomore year at college, I started working on this project, under guidance of Prof. Rangan Banerjee. The goal was to develop a systems theory based approach energy use in large socio-economic systems. It all started when I got hold of any energy audit report of my college campus. It took no time to converge on the campus to be the system under observation. 

After talking to my guide and a couple of seniors I was able to get hold of some data and validate some bold assumptions I made, but the overall framework, although qualitative in nature turned out to be correct! Let me take you through it!!

We will focus on the energy usage by on campus residents. Equipment like lights, ceiling fans, water heaters, washing machines, cookstoves are provided to all students staying on campus. The energy usage depends on the number of residents, hence we explore a qualitative yet detailed model of the Population Dynamics.
